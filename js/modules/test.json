And today, whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation &#8211; the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace. That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We meet at one of those defining moments &#8211; a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great &#8211; a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security. That is not how moral authority is claimed; that is how it is surrendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it&#8217;s not who we are. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, we&#8217;ll be talking about some other distraction. Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism &#8211; it is an important part of promoting peace. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is on your lips and in your heart. And they are a part of America, this country that I love. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our ideals. Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. But I think they also sensed that a part of me remained removed and detached &#8211; that I was an observer in their midst. So let there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. This history is well known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n",
